# ---------------- Implementation for Linux Service --------------------------------------------------------------------

# [Unit]
# Description = Logging service for Tr-064 Device
# After = network.target  # Assuming you want to start after network interfaces are made available
#
# [Service]
# Type = simple
# ExecStart = python < Path to File >
# User =  # User to run the script as
# Group =  # Group to run the script as
# Restart = on - failure  # Restart when there are errors
# SyslogIdentifier = TR-064 Relais Service
# RestartSec = 5
# TimeoutStartSec = infinity
#
# [Install]
# WantedBy = multi - user.target  # Make it accessible to other users


# File is intended to be executed as a service or cron job on linux repeatedly
# needs error handling if something in the connection went wrong
# needs initial setup for making HOST, PORT, UID and PASSWD available
# build cron job version und service version (terminated version, recuring loop)

# vorraussetzung installiertes syslog monitoring f√ºr client

# persistent data in /var/app_name/logs

# secret handling???? file with permissions?


# todo:
# cron job vs linux service
#   add Unit File for Linux Service


# Used for more granular Error handling acording to HTTP Response Code
